Agile Manifesto Exercise

Case Study: Developing an Agile Manifesto with a Student Project

Background
A group of software engineering students has been tasked with creating a digital Agile Manifesto as part of their semester project. This exercise is designed to simulate the Agile development process, allowing the students to practice Agile principles, roles, and ceremonies.

The team will work collaboratively, applying Agile methodologies such as Epics, Features/Stories, Sprints, Story Points, and Subtasks to successfully complete the project.

Project Objective
The goal is to develop a web-based Agile Manifesto platform where users can:

1.Learn about the core values and principles of Agile.
2.Access interactive examples and resources.
3.Collaborate and exchange ideas on Agile methodologies.

Step-by-Step Plan
1. Project Kickoff
The instructor assumes the role of the Product Owner and provides the following requirements:

A homepage that explains the Agile Manifesto.
Interactive content for exploring Agile values and principles.
A resource library featuring Agile practices such as Scrum and Kanban.
Collaboration tools, including a discussion forum or comment section.
The team organizes a kickoff meeting to:

Clarify the project’s objectives.
Assign roles (Scrum Master, Developers, Tester).
Define the scope of the project.

2. Epic Creation
The team establishes the primary Epic for the project:
Epic: "Develop a web platform to educate and engage users on the Agile Manifesto and its methodologies."

3. Features and Stories Breakdown
The Epic is divided into Features and Stories as follows:

Feature 1: Homepage for Agile Manifesto

Story 1.1: Design and create an engaging homepage.
Story 1.2: Add an introduction to Agile and its history.
Story 1.3: Implement navigation to other sections.
Feature 2: Agile Values and Principles

Story 2.1: Create a page to showcase the four core Agile values.
Story 2.2: Implement an interactive module for the 12 principles.
Story 2.3: Add examples to explain each value and principle.
Feature 3: Resource Library

Story 3.1: Design a library for Agile practices like Scrum and Kanban.
Story 3.2: Include downloadable resources such as templates and guides.
Story 3.3: Add search and filter capabilities.
Feature 4: Collaboration Tools

Story 4.1: Create a user discussion forum.
Story 4.2: Add commenting functionality for resources and principles.
Story 4.3: Implement user authentication for collaborative features.

4. Sprint Planning
The project is divided into four 2-week Sprints:

Sprint 1: Build the Agile Manifesto homepage.
Sprint 2: Develop the Agile Values and Principles section.
Sprint 3: Create the Resource Library.
Sprint 4: Implement Collaboration Tools and finalize testing.
The team uses Planning Poker to estimate Story Points:

Small tasks: 1–2 points.
Medium tasks: 3–5 points.
Large tasks: 8–13 points.

5. Subtasks for Stories
Each Story is broken into smaller, actionable Subtasks. Examples:

Story 1.1: Design and create an engaging homepage

Subtask 1.1.1: Create wireframes for the homepage.
Subtask 1.1.2: Develop the layout using HTML and CSS.
Subtask 1.1.3: Add animations using JavaScript.
Subtask 1.1.4: Conduct user testing and incorporate feedback.
Story 4.2: Add commenting functionality for resources and principles

Subtask 4.2.1: Design the comment input field and user interface.
Subtask 4.2.2: Create backend APIs for comment storage.
Subtask 4.2.3: Integrate APIs with the frontend.
Subtask 4.2.4: Test and refine the comment functionality.

6. Daily Stand-ups
The team conducts daily 15-minute stand-up meetings to discuss:

Progress made the previous day.
Planned tasks for the day.
Any challenges or blockers.

7. Sprint Reviews
At the end of each Sprint, the team presents their progress to the Product Owner (instructor). Feedback is collected and integrated into the subsequent Sprint.

8. Sprint Retrospectives
After each Sprint, the team holds a retrospective to evaluate:

Successes during the Sprint.
Areas for improvement.
Actionable changes for the next Sprint.

9. Final Delivery
After the fourth Sprint, the team delivers the final platform, which includes:

A fully developed and polished homepage.
Interactive pages for Agile values and principles.
A resource library with search and filter features.
Collaboration tools like a discussion forum and comments, with user authentication.
Lessons Learned
Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Breaking down complex projects into manageable parts using Epics, Features, and Stories.
Estimating effort and prioritizing tasks with Story Points.
Collaborating effectively through Agile ceremonies and communication.
Iterative development and continuous improvement.
Gathering and incorporating feedback from stakeholders for better outcomes.
